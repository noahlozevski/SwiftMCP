/// - Parameters:
///   - timeout: The time duration in which `operation` is allowed to run before timing out.
///   - tolerance: The time duriation that is allowed for task scheduler to delay operation timeout
///   in case of computationaly sparse resource.
///   - clock: The clock which is suitable for task scheduling.
///   - operation: The asynchronous operation to perform.
/// - Returns: The result of `operation` if it completed in time.
/// - Throws: Throws ``TimedOutError`` if the timeout expires before `operation` completes.
///   If `operation` throws an error before the timeout expires, that error is propagated to the caller.
